This code presents a webscrapping generic algorithm using SeleniumWebDriver for detecting a website word.

This code also creates an application to send a smartphone push notification using the API Pushbullet and implements a smtplib authentication method using a API KEY so that when a given situation is detected those two different kinds of notifications will be send to the devices owner.
